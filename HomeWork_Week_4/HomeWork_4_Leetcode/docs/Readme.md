### HW_4_Leetcode  : 3 Tasks from Leetcode.com

#### Task1:

- Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

* You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

#### Task2:

- Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly
  twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

* You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

- Constraints:

* 2 <= num6s.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
* Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

#### Task3:

- Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find
  the single element and return it.

* You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
* Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
